  <h1>Give One Taka Daily, Change Bangladesh Gradually</h1> 
  <p class="white center">Ek Takay Shikkha, a social organisation, has been in operation since 2017 with a mission to ensure that one's financial condition does not restrict them from acquiring an education. It started in July 2017, when a group of Chittagong University students were hanging out, and some underprivileged children by the street asked them for money. </p>
